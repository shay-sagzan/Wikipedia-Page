          <p>
          An <b> apple</b> is an edible fruit produced by an <b> apple tree (Malus
          domestica) </b>. Apple trees are cultivated worldwide and are the most
          widely grown species in the genus Malus. The tree originated in
          Central Asia, where its wild ancestor, Malus sieversii, is still found
          today. Apples have been grown for thousands of years in Asia and
          Europe and were brought to North America by European colonists. Apples
          have religious and mythological significance in many cultures,
          including Norse, Greek, and European Christian tradition.</p>
          
          <p> grown
          from seed tend to be very different from those of their parents, and
          the resultant fruit frequently lacks desired characteristics.
          Generally, apple cultivars are propagated by clonal grafting onto
          rootstocks. Apple trees grown without rootstocks tend to be larger and
          much slower to fruit after planting. Rootstocks are used to control
          the speed of growth and the size of the resulting tree, allowing for
          easier harvesting.
          </p>
          <p>There are more than 7,500 known cultivars of
          apples. Different cultivars are bred for various tastes and uses,
          including cooking, eating raw, and cider production. Trees and fruit
          are prone to a number of fungal, bacterial, and pest problems, which
          can be controlled by a number of organic and non-organic means. In
          2010, the fruit's genome was sequenced as part of research on disease
          control and selective breeding in apple production.</p> 
          Worldwide
          production of apples in 2018 was 86 million tonnes, with China
          accounting for nearly half of the total.<sup>[3]</sup>

        <h3 id="second-heading">Etymology</h3>
        <p>
          The word apple, formerly spelled æppel in Old English, is derived from
          the Proto-Germanic root *ap(a)laz, which could also mean fruit in
          general. This is ultimately derived from Proto-Indo-European *ab(e)l-,
          but the precise original meaning and the relationship between both
          words[clarification needed] is uncertain.</p>
          As late as the 17th century,
          the word also functioned as a generic term for all fruit other than
          berries but including nuts—such as the 14th century Middle English
          word appel of paradis, meaning a banana.[4] This use is analogous to
          the French language use of pomme.

            <div class="col">
              <p>
                The apple is a deciduous tree, generally standing 2 to 4.5 m (6 to 15
                ft) tall in cultivation and up to 9 m (30 ft) in the wild. When
                cultivated, the size, shape and branch density are determined by
                rootstock selection and trimming method. The leaves are alternately
                arranged dark green-colored simple ovals with serrated margins and
                slightly downy undersides.[5]</p>
                <p>Apple blossom Blossoms are produced in
                spring simultaneously with the budding of the leaves and are produced
                on spurs and some long shoots. The 3 to 4 cm (1 to 1+1⁄2 in) flowers
                are white with a pink tinge that gradually fades, five petaled, with
                an inflorescence consisting of a cyme with 4–6 flowers. The central
                flower of the inflorescence is called the "king bloom"; it opens first
                and can develop a larger fruit.[5][6]</p>
                The fruit is a pome that matures
                in late summer or autumn, and cultivars exist in a wide range of
                sizes. Commercial growers aim to produce an apple that is 7 to 8.5 cm
                (2+3⁄4 to 3+1⁄4 in) in diameter, due to market preference. Some
                consumers, especially those in Japan, prefer a larger apple, while
                apples below 5.5 cm (2+1⁄4 in) are generally used for making juice and
                have little fresh market value. The skin of ripe apples is generally
                red, yellow, green, pink, or russetted, though many bi- or tri-colored
                cultivars may be found.[7] The skin may also be wholly or partly
                russeted i.e. rough and brown. The skin is covered in a protective
                layer of epicuticular wax.[8] The exocarp (flesh) is generally pale
                yellowish-white,[7] though pink, yellow or green exocarps also
                occur.[9]

                <p>
                  The original wild ancestor of Malus domestica was Malus sieversii,
                  found growing wild in the mountains of Central Asia in southern
                  Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and northwestern China.[5][10]
                  Cultivation of the species, most likely beginning on the forested
                  flanks of the Tian Shan mountains, progressed over a long period of
                  time and permitted secondary introgression of genes from other
                  species into the open-pollinated seeds. Significant exchange with
                  Malus sylvestris, the crabapple, resulted in current populations of
                  apples being more related to crabapples than to the more
                  morphologically similar progenitor Malus sieversii. In strains
                  without recent admixture the contribution of the latter
                  predominates.[11][12][13]

          <h5><b>Genome</b></h2>
          <p>
            Apple is diploid (though triploid cultivars are not uncommon), has
            17 chromosomes and an estimated genome size of approximately 650 Mb.
            Several whole genome sequences have been made available, the first
            one in 2010 was based on the diploid cultivar 'Golden
            Delicious'.[14] However, this first whole genome sequence turned out
            to contain several errors[15] in part owing to the high degree of
            heterozygosity in diploid apples which, in combination with an
            ancient genome duplication, complicated the assembly. Recently,
            double- and trihaploid individuals have been sequenced, yielding
            whole genome sequences of higher quality.[16][17] The first whole
            genome assembly was estimated to contain around 57,000 genes,[14]
            though the more recent genome sequences support more moderate
            estimates between 42,000 and 44,700 protein-coding genes.[16][17]
            Among other things, the availability of whole genome sequences has
            provided evidence that the wild ancestor of the cultivated apple
            most likely is Malus sieversii. Re-sequencing of multiple accessions
            has supported this, while also suggesting extensive introgression
            from Malus sylvestris following domestication.[18] History

        <p>
          Malus sieversii is recognized as a major progenitor species to the
          cultivated apple, and is morphologically similar. Due to the genetic
          variability in Central Asia, this region is generally considered the
          center of origin for apples.[19] The apple is thought to have been
          domesticated 4000–10000 years ago in the Tian Shan mountains, and then
          to have travelled along the Silk Road to Europe, with hybridization
          and introgression of wild crabapples from Siberia (M. baccata), the
          Caucasus (M. orientalis), and Europe (M. sylvestris). Only the M.
          sieversii trees growing on the western side of the Tian Shan mountains
          contributed genetically to the domesticated apple, not the isolated
          population on the eastern side.[18] Chinese soft apples, such as M.
          asiatica and M. prunifolia, have been cultivated as dessert apples for
          more than 2000 years in China. These are thought to be hybrids between
          M. baccata and M. sieversii in Kazakhstan.[18] Among the traits
          selected for by human growers are size, fruit acidity, color,
          firmness, and soluble sugar. Unusually for domesticated fruits, the
          wild M. sieversii origin is only slightly smaller than the modern
          domesticated apple.[18] At the Sammardenchia-Cueis site near Udine in
          Northeastern Italy, seeds from some form of apples have been found in
          material carbon dated to around 4000 BCE.[20] Genetic analysis has not
          yet been successfully used to determine whether such ancient apples
          were wild Malus sylvestris or Malus domesticus containing Malus
          sieversii ancestry.[21] It is generally also hard to distinguish in
          the archeological record between foraged wild apples and apple
          plantations. There is indirect evidence of apple cultivation in the
          third millennium BCE in the Middle East. There was substantial apple
          production in the European classical antiquity, and grafting was
          certainly known then.[21] Grafting is an essential part of modern
          domesticated apple production, to be able to propagate the best
          cultivars; it is unclear when apple tree grafting was invented.[21]
          Winter apples, picked in late autumn and stored just above freezing,
          have been an important food in Asia and Europe for millennia.[22] Of
          the many Old World plants that the Spanish introduced to Chiloé
          Archipelago in the 16th century, apple trees became particularly well
          adapted.[23] Apples were introduced to North America by colonists in
          the 17th century,[5] and the first apple orchard on the North American
          continent was planted in Boston by Reverend William Blaxton in
          1625.[24] The only apples native to North America are crab apples,
          which were once called "common apples".[25] Apple cultivars brought as
          seed from Europe were spread along Native American trade routes, as
          well as being cultivated on colonial farms. An 1845 United States
          apples nursery catalogue sold 350 of the "best" cultivars, showing the
          proliferation of new North American cultivars by the early 19th
          century.[25] In the 20th century, irrigation projects in Eastern
          Washington began and allowed the development of the
          multibillion-dollar fruit industry, of which the apple is the leading
          product.[5] Until the 20th century, farmers stored apples in
          frostproof cellars during the winter for their own use or for sale.
          Improved transportation of fresh apples by train and road replaced the
          necessity for storage.[26][27] Controlled atmosphere facilities are
          used to keep apples fresh year-round. Controlled atmosphere facilities
          use high humidity, low oxygen, and controlled carbon dioxide levels to
          maintain fruit freshness. They were first used in the United States in
          the 1960s.[28]

        <h5><b>Germanic paganism</b></h2>
          <p>
            In Norse mythology, the goddess Iðunn is portrayed in the Prose Edda (written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson) as providing apples to the gods that give them eternal youthfulness. The English scholar H. R. Ellis Davidson links apples to religious practices in Germanic paganism, from which Norse paganism developed. She points out that buckets of apples were found in the Oseberg ship burial site in Norway, that fruit and nuts (Iðunn having been described as being transformed into a nut in Skáldskaparmál) have been found in the early graves of the Germanic peoples in England and elsewhere on the continent of Europe, which may have had a symbolic meaning, and that nuts are still a recognized symbol of fertility in southwest England.[29]

            Davidson notes a connection between apples and the Vanir, a tribe of gods associated with fertility in Norse mythology, citing an instance of eleven "golden apples" being given to woo the beautiful Gerðr by Skírnir, who was acting as messenger for the major Vanir god Freyr in stanzas 19 and 20 of Skírnismál. Davidson also notes a further connection between fertility and apples in Norse mythology in chapter 2 of the Völsunga saga: when the major goddess Frigg sends King Rerir an apple after he prays to Odin for a child, Frigg's messenger (in the guise of a crow) drops the apple in his lap as he sits atop a mound.[30] Rerir's wife's consumption of the apple results in a six-year pregnancy and the birth (by Caesarean section) of their son—the hero Völsung.[31]
            
            Further, Davidson points out the "strange" phrase "Apples of Hel" used in an 11th-century poem by the skald Thorbiorn Brúnarson. She states this may imply that the apple was thought of by Brúnarson as the food of the dead. Further, Davidson notes that the potentially Germanic goddess Nehalennia is sometimes depicted with apples and that parallels exist in early Irish stories. Davidson asserts that while cultivation of the apple in Northern Europe extends back to at least the time of the Roman Empire and came to Europe from the Near East, the native varieties of apple trees growing in Northern Europe are small and bitter. Davidson concludes that in the figure of Iðunn "we must have a dim reflection of an old symbol: that of the guardian goddess of the life-giving fruit of the other world."[29]

          <h5><b>Greek mythology</b></h2>
            <p>
              Apples appear in many religious traditions, often as a mystical or forbidden fruit. One of the problems identifying apples in religion, mythology and folktales is that the word "apple" was used as a generic term for all (foreign) fruit, other than berries, including nuts, as late as the 17th century.[32] For instance, in Greek mythology, the Greek hero Heracles, as a part of his Twelve Labours, was required to travel to the Garden of the Hesperides and pick the golden apples off the Tree of Life growing at its center.[33][34][35]
              The Greek goddess of discord, Eris, became disgruntled after she was excluded from the wedding of Peleus and Thetis.[36] In retaliation, she tossed a golden apple inscribed Καλλίστη (Kalliste, sometimes transliterated Kallisti, "For the most beautiful one"), into the wedding party. Three goddesses claimed the apple: Hera, Athena, and Aphrodite. Paris of Troy was appointed to select the recipient. After being bribed by both Hera and Athena, Aphrodite tempted him with the most beautiful woman in the world, Helen of Sparta. He awarded the apple to Aphrodite, thus indirectly causing the Trojan War.[37]
              The apple was thus considered, in ancient Greece, sacred to Aphrodite. To throw an apple at someone was to symbolically declare one's love; and similarly, to catch it was to symbolically show one's acceptance of that love. An epigram claiming authorship by Plato states:[38]
              I throw the apple at you, and if you are willing to love me, take it and share your girlhood with me; but if your thoughts are what I pray they are not, even then take it, and consider how short-lived is beauty.
              — Plato, Epigram VII
              Atalanta, also of Greek mythology, raced all her suitors in an attempt to avoid marriage. She outran all but Hippomenes (also known as Melanion, a name possibly derived from melon, the Greek word for both "apple" and fruit in general),[34] who defeated her by cunning, not speed. Hippomenes knew that he could not win in a fair race, so he used three golden apples (gifts of Aphrodite, the goddess of love) to distract Atalanta. It took all three apples and all of his speed, but Hippomenes was finally successful, winning the race and Atalanta's hand.[33]

            <h5><b>Christian art</b></h2>
              <p>
                Though the forbidden fruit of Eden in the Book of Genesis is not identified, popular Christian tradition has held that it was an apple that Eve coaxed Adam to share with her.[39] The origin of the popular identification with a fruit unknown in the Middle East in biblical times is found in confusion between the Latin words mālum (an apple) and mălum (an evil), each of which is normally written malum.[40] The tree of the forbidden fruit is called "the tree of the knowledge of good and evil" in Genesis 2:17,[41] and the Latin for "good and evil" is bonum et malum.[42]
                Renaissance painters may also have been influenced by the story of the golden apples in the Garden of Hesperides. As a result, in the story of Adam and Eve, the apple became a symbol for knowledge, immortality, temptation, the fall of man into sin, and sin itself. The larynx in the human throat has been called the "Adam's apple" because of a notion that it was caused by the forbidden fruit remaining in the throat of Adam.[39] The apple as symbol of sexual seduction has been used to imply human sexuality, possibly in an ironic vein.[39]

                <p>
                  The proverb, "An apple a day keeps the doctor away", addressing the supposed health benefits of the fruit, has been traced to 19th-century Wales, where the original phrase was "Eat an apple on going to bed, and you'll keep the doctor from earning his bread".[43] In the 19th century and early 20th, the phrase evolved to "an apple a day, no doctor to pay" and "an apple a day sends the doctor away"; the phrasing now commonly used was first recorded in 1922.[44] Despite the proverb, there is no evidence that eating an apple daily has any significant health effects.[45]
