        <h1 id="first-heading">Apple</h1>
        <p>
          An apple is an edible fruit produced by an apple tree (Malus
          domestica). Apple trees are cultivated worldwide and are the most
          widely grown species in the genus Malus. The tree originated in
          Central Asia, where its wild ancestor, Malus sieversii, is still found
          today. Apples have been grown for thousands of years in Asia and
          Europe and were brought to North America by European colonists. Apples
          have religious and mythological significance in many cultures,
          including Norse, Greek, and European Christian tradition. Apples grown
          from seed tend to be very different from those of their parents, and
          the resultant fruit frequently lacks desired characteristics.
          Generally, apple cultivars are propagated by clonal grafting onto
          rootstocks. Apple trees grown without rootstocks tend to be larger and
          much slower to fruit after planting. Rootstocks are used to control
          the speed of growth and the size of the resulting tree, allowing for
          easier harvesting. There are more than 7,500 known cultivars of
          apples. Different cultivars are bred for various tastes and uses,
          including cooking, eating raw, and cider production. Trees and fruit
          are prone to a number of fungal, bacterial, and pest problems, which
          can be controlled by a number of organic and non-organic means. In
          2010, the fruit's genome was sequenced as part of research on disease
          control and selective breeding in apple production. Worldwide
          production of apples in 2018 was 86 million tonnes, with China
          accounting for nearly half of the total.[3]

        <h2 id="second-heading">Etymology</h2>
        <p>
          The word apple, formerly spelled æppel in Old English, is derived from
          the Proto-Germanic root *ap(a)laz, which could also mean fruit in
          general. This is ultimately derived from Proto-Indo-European *ab(e)l-,
          but the precise original meaning and the relationship between both
          words[clarification needed] is uncertain. As late as the 17th century,
          the word also functioned as a generic term for all fruit other than
          berries but including nuts—such as the 14th century Middle English
          word appel of paradis, meaning a banana.[4] This use is analogous to
          the French language use of pomme.

        <p>
          The apple is a deciduous tree, generally standing 2 to 4.5 m (6 to 15
          ft) tall in cultivation and up to 9 m (30 ft) in the wild. When
          cultivated, the size, shape and branch density are determined by
          rootstock selection and trimming method. The leaves are alternately
          arranged dark green-colored simple ovals with serrated margins and
          slightly downy undersides.[5] Apple blossom Blossoms are produced in
          spring simultaneously with the budding of the leaves and are produced
          on spurs and some long shoots. The 3 to 4 cm (1 to 1+1⁄2 in) flowers
          are white with a pink tinge that gradually fades, five petaled, with
          an inflorescence consisting of a cyme with 4–6 flowers. The central
          flower of the inflorescence is called the "king bloom"; it opens first
          and can develop a larger fruit.[5][6] The fruit is a pome that matures
          in late summer or autumn, and cultivars exist in a wide range of
          sizes. Commercial growers aim to produce an apple that is 7 to 8.5 cm
          (2+3⁄4 to 3+1⁄4 in) in diameter, due to market preference. Some
          consumers, especially those in Japan, prefer a larger apple, while
          apples below 5.5 cm (2+1⁄4 in) are generally used for making juice and
          have little fresh market value. The skin of ripe apples is generally
          red, yellow, green, pink, or russetted, though many bi- or tri-colored
          cultivars may be found.[7] The skin may also be wholly or partly
          russeted i.e. rough and brown. The skin is covered in a protective
          layer of epicuticular wax.[8] The exocarp (flesh) is generally pale
          yellowish-white,[7] though pink, yellow or green exocarps also
          occur.[9]

          <h3>Wild ancestors</h3>

          <p>
            The original wild ancestor of Malus domestica was Malus sieversii,
            found growing wild in the mountains of Central Asia in southern
            Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and northwestern China.[5][10]
            Cultivation of the species, most likely beginning on the forested
            flanks of the Tian Shan mountains, progressed over a long period of
            time and permitted secondary introgression of genes from other
            species into the open-pollinated seeds. Significant exchange with
            Malus sylvestris, the crabapple, resulted in current populations of
            apples being more related to crabapples than to the more
            morphologically similar progenitor Malus sieversii. In strains
            without recent admixture the contribution of the latter
            predominates.[11][12][13]

          <h3>Genome</h3>
          <p>
            Apple is diploid (though triploid cultivars are not uncommon), has
            17 chromosomes and an estimated genome size of approximately 650 Mb.
            Several whole genome sequences have been made available, the first
            one in 2010 was based on the diploid cultivar 'Golden
            Delicious'.[14] However, this first whole genome sequence turned out
            to contain several errors[15] in part owing to the high degree of
            heterozygosity in diploid apples which, in combination with an
            ancient genome duplication, complicated the assembly. Recently,
            double- and trihaploid individuals have been sequenced, yielding
            whole genome sequences of higher quality.[16][17] The first whole
            genome assembly was estimated to contain around 57,000 genes,[14]
            though the more recent genome sequences support more moderate
            estimates between 42,000 and 44,700 protein-coding genes.[16][17]
            Among other things, the availability of whole genome sequences has
            provided evidence that the wild ancestor of the cultivated apple
            most likely is Malus sieversii. Re-sequencing of multiple accessions
            has supported this, while also suggesting extensive introgression
            from Malus sylvestris following domestication.[18] History

        <h2 id="fourth-heading">History</h2>
        <p>
          Malus sieversii is recognized as a major progenitor species to the
          cultivated apple, and is morphologically similar. Due to the genetic
          variability in Central Asia, this region is generally considered the
          center of origin for apples.[19] The apple is thought to have been
          domesticated 4000–10000 years ago in the Tian Shan mountains, and then
          to have travelled along the Silk Road to Europe, with hybridization
          and introgression of wild crabapples from Siberia (M. baccata), the
          Caucasus (M. orientalis), and Europe (M. sylvestris). Only the M.
          sieversii trees growing on the western side of the Tian Shan mountains
          contributed genetically to the domesticated apple, not the isolated
          population on the eastern side.[18] Chinese soft apples, such as M.
          asiatica and M. prunifolia, have been cultivated as dessert apples for
          more than 2000 years in China. These are thought to be hybrids between
          M. baccata and M. sieversii in Kazakhstan.[18] Among the traits
          selected for by human growers are size, fruit acidity, color,
          firmness, and soluble sugar. Unusually for domesticated fruits, the
          wild M. sieversii origin is only slightly smaller than the modern
          domesticated apple.[18] At the Sammardenchia-Cueis site near Udine in
          Northeastern Italy, seeds from some form of apples have been found in
          material carbon dated to around 4000 BCE.[20] Genetic analysis has not
          yet been successfully used to determine whether such ancient apples
          were wild Malus sylvestris or Malus domesticus containing Malus
          sieversii ancestry.[21] It is generally also hard to distinguish in
          the archeological record between foraged wild apples and apple
          plantations. There is indirect evidence of apple cultivation in the
          third millennium BCE in the Middle East. There was substantial apple
          production in the European classical antiquity, and grafting was
          certainly known then.[21] Grafting is an essential part of modern
          domesticated apple production, to be able to propagate the best
          cultivars; it is unclear when apple tree grafting was invented.[21]
          Winter apples, picked in late autumn and stored just above freezing,
          have been an important food in Asia and Europe for millennia.[22] Of
          the many Old World plants that the Spanish introduced to Chiloé
          Archipelago in the 16th century, apple trees became particularly well
          adapted.[23] Apples were introduced to North America by colonists in
          the 17th century,[5] and the first apple orchard on the North American
          continent was planted in Boston by Reverend William Blaxton in
          1625.[24] The only apples native to North America are crab apples,
          which were once called "common apples".[25] Apple cultivars brought as
          seed from Europe were spread along Native American trade routes, as
          well as being cultivated on colonial farms. An 1845 United States
          apples nursery catalogue sold 350 of the "best" cultivars, showing the
          proliferation of new North American cultivars by the early 19th
          century.[25] In the 20th century, irrigation projects in Eastern
          Washington began and allowed the development of the
          multibillion-dollar fruit industry, of which the apple is the leading
          product.[5] Until the 20th century, farmers stored apples in
          frostproof cellars during the winter for their own use or for sale.
          Improved transportation of fresh apples by train and road replaced the
          necessity for storage.[26][27] Controlled atmosphere facilities are
          used to keep apples fresh year-round. Controlled atmosphere facilities
          use high humidity, low oxygen, and controlled carbon dioxide levels to
          maintain fruit freshness. They were first used in the United States in
          the 1960s.[28]
